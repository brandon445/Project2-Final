To view user endpoints: 
(may have to wait a little, conda activate base has to happen on my machine)


Run the app4.py and enter in the url
"/stock" to view company information

"/sectors" to view classification

"/year" to view the applicable years


This page is only here for access to the user endpoints


app2.py runs the interactive graph over time - PlotPage.ipynb does this for pandas also


3PlotPages opens 3 seperate browser pages for 3 different interactive charts
